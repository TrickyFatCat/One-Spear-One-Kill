# One Spear, One Kill
__Welcome to the arena good hunter!__

On this arena you have only one weapon - a spear, it's your only best friend here, who helps you to fight against hordes of deadliest creatures. You can only throw it into your enemies and each time you do this, you lose it and should get the spear back yourself. Only the best can become  the master of the arena.

__Good luck and fight with glory!__
